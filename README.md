This is a model of contention-based (without prior booking) patient consultation in a clinic. It allows the simulation of the waiting time of patients in a queue of type FIFO (First In First Out) using adjustable variables such as the initial patient count, the number of available waiting seats, the arrival rate of new patients and the rate at which the clinic consults patients. This could help clinics (or similar institutions) understand the impact of these variables on the waiting time of their patients (or clients).
